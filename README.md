# Task-Management
Task Management App
This is a simple task management web application built using React with React Router DOM for navigation. It allows users to add, delete, and manage tasks. The tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.

Features
Add Task: Users can add a task with a title and description.
Delete Task: Users can delete tasks.
Persistent Storage: Tasks are stored in localStorage so that they persist across browser sessions.
Routing: Includes basic routing with React Router DOM, featuring a Home page and an About page.
